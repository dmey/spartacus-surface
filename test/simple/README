Calling "make" in this directory will run SPARTACUS-Surface on the
following test input files:

  test_surfaces_in.nc - tests the four surface types (flat, forest,
    unvegetated urban and vegetated urban) with a simple two-layer
    canopy

  test_consistency_in.nc - tests the consistency of the forest and
    urban solvers by running them on an identical forest profile; the
    fluxes components ought to be the same for these two profiles

  test_empty_layers_in.nc - tests for the correct behaviour in layers
    where the building or vegetation cover are set to zero, and in
    those layers the effective building or tree size is also set to
    zero

  test_nearly_empty_layers_in.nc - validation case for
    test_empty_layers_in.nc: small but non-zero values for building
    and vegetation cover, so should be very close to the case when
    they are actually zero

  test_noscat_in.nc - as test_surfaces_in.nc but with all albedos set
    to 0 and all emissivities set to 1, in order to more easily test
    behaviour against analytical results in the case of no scattering

  test_closed_in.nc - tests for "closed" canopies: cases when
    vegetation fills a forest domain or fills the street in an urban
    area

The results are written in *_out.nc.
